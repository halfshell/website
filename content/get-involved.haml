      At the moment, `Halfshell` is merely a dream. To get this project underway will require
      **feedback**,  **funding** and an **awesome cofounder** who isn't afraid
      to build things that nobody has ever attempted before.

          I am planning a crowdfunding campaign to gauge interest
          and raise money to pay the rent while we develop an initial release.
